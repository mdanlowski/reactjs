# reactjs
### ReactJS exercise and practice

Learning react.js. The repository allows me to work on code from multiple machiines.

This is also where some bigger projects will end up being.

### Ideas:
- [ ] Refactor https://mdanlowski.github.io to React
- [ ] Obviously a TODO app with noSQL db
- [ ] Collaborative DrumMachine on Node through Websockets
